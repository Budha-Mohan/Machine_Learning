# Machine Learning Learning Journey

Welcome to my Machine Learning Learning Journey! ðŸš€ In this repository, I am documenting my daily progress in machine learning.

## Overview
I have embarked on a challenge to learn a subtopic of machine learning each day. This repository serves as a public record of my learning journey, 
providing insights into the concepts I've explored, the resources I've utilized, and the challenges I've overcome.

## Structure
The repository is organized into daily folders, with each folder corresponding to a specific day in my learning journey.
Within each daily folder, you'll find:

- **Notes:** Detailed notes on the subtopic covered that day.
- **Code:** Implementation of the concepts learned, often accompanied by comments for clarity.
- **Resources:** A list of the resources I found helpful for that particular day.

## Learning Progress

- **Day 1:**
  - [SUPERVISED LEARNING]
  - [Notes](Day1/Notes.md)
    and
  - [UNSUPERVISED LEARNING]
  - [Notes](Day1/Notes.md)


- **Day 2:** [Subtopic 2]
  - [Notes](Day2/Notes.md)
  - [Code](Day2/Code/)
  - [Resources](Day2/Resources.md)


## Future Plans

As I progress through this learning journey, I plan to explore a wide range of machine learning subtopics, including but not limited to:
- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- Reinforcement Learning

Stay tuned for daily updates as I continue my exploration of the exciting field of machine learning!

## Feedback
I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or corrections. Feel free to open an issue or reach out to me directly.

Happy coding! ðŸ¤–
